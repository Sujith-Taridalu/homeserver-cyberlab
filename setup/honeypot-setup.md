# üïµÔ∏è Honeypot Setup Guide (Cowrie on Ubuntu)

This guide walks through setting up a low-interaction SSH honeypot using [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie). The goal is to simulate a vulnerable system and log attacker activity in a controlled, safe environment.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- A Linux VM
- Python 3 installed
- Internet access to install dependencies
- Another machine (e.g., Kali Linux) to simulate attacks

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a dedicated user

```bash
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" cowrie
```

### 2. Switch to that user

```bash
sudo -u cowrie -H bash
cd ~
```

### 3. Clone Cowrie and enter the directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git
cd cowrie
```

### 4. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure Cowrie

```bash
cp etc/cowrie.cfg.dist etc/cowrie.cfg
nano etc/cowrie.cfg
```

Look for this line and make sure it says:
```ini
listen_endpoints = tcp:2222:interface=0.0.0.0
```

> **Why port 2222?**  
> Port 22 is used by *real* SSH servers. We use 2222 to avoid conflicts and keep Cowrie isolated.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Most attackers scan a **wide range of ports**, including 2222, 222, 8022, etc. So using 2222 still attracts opportunistic bots and scans. It‚Äôs commonly used in honeypots ‚Äî and logs still flood in even on this port.

Save and exit.

### 6. Start Cowrie

Make sure you're in the Cowrie folder:
```bash
bin/cowrie start
```

Check if it's running:
```bash
bin/cowrie status
```

![Cowrie bin Start and Status](../Screenshots/Honey%20pot/cowrie%20start%20&%20status.png)

*Figure 1: Cowrie bin Start and Status*

Output:
```
Cowrie is running with PID 6760
```

---

### 7. Connect from another machine

From your Kali or any other box in the same network:

```bash
ssh root@192.168.1.188 -p 2222
```

Try random usernames and passwords ‚Äî Cowrie logs them all and all commands will be recorded in the log file.

---

## üîç Where to Find Logs

Cowrie logs to:
```
/home/cowrie/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json
```

To monitor logs in real time:
```bash
tail -f /home/cowrie/cowrie/var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json
```

*Figure 2: Log*

Log events include:
- Login attempts (successful/fake or failed)
- Commands entered in the fake shell
- Session start/end
- Connection IPs, ports, timestamps

---

## üßº To Stop Cowrie

```bash
bin/cowrie stop
```
